👋 Hi, I'm @amirmali
- 👀 I'm interested in all networks of all kinds, from computer networks to social networks, data science, and security. Currently, I work as an infosec advisor at the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and moonlight as a computer science master's student at Georgia Tech.
- 🌱 I'm currently (and continuously) learning about network and data science.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on data science projects and competitions.<!-- -->
